## About The Project
As a frequent contributor to my GitHub repository, I've often struggled with finding the perfect README template that suits my needs. After hours of scouring through various templates, I've decided to take matters into my own hands and create my very own README template. My aim is to create a comprehensive yet concise guide that outlines all the necessary information regarding my projects, including: 
* Installation instructions
* Usage examples
* Contribution guidelines 

This template will streamline the process of creating README files and provide value to other developers who are looking for a similar solution. I'm excited to share my template with the community and hope that it will make the process of creating README files a lot easier for others. Please give this project a :star2: star :star2: if you find it useful!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` (_in progress_) to get started!
